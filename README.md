üìå Analysis:  

Based on the data presented in the dashboard, the procurement activities for raw materials, goods, and semi-finished products during the reviewed period can be assessed as follows:

- Order fulfillment and product quality are at optimal levels: Both the Fulfillment Rate and Defect Rate are at 100% and 0% respectively, indicating a highly efficient procurement and inbound logistics process.

- Significant supply disruption from August onwards: Received quantity and procurement value dropped sharply in August and completely halted by September. This signals potential disruption in the supply chain, possibly due to order delays, halted production schedules, budget constraints, or bottlenecks in internal approval processes.

- Overstocking across multiple items: Numerous products show excessive inventory levels far exceeding their Reorder Points and Safety Stock thresholds, posing risks of inventory obsolescence, increased storage costs, and inefficient capital utilization.

- Poor performance in certain products: Lock Washer 4, 5 and Lock Nut 5, 6 exhibit high defect/return rates (above 9%), while Sport-100 Helmet shows an extremely low fulfillment rate (6.67%). This could directly impact production continuity if these are critical components.

üí° Recommendation:  

Based on the findings above, the following actions are recommended:

- Investigate supply chain disruption from August onwards: Review open purchase orders, procurement schedules, and supplier delivery status. Verify that there are no internal bottlenecks in the approval or payment process.

- Re-evaluate inventory policies: Adjust Safety Stock and Reorder Points, especially for overstocked items. Prioritize consumption of existing stock and implement stock alerts within Power BI to prevent over-ordering.

- Reassess suppliers with poor performance: Perform a vendor performance review focused on suppliers linked to high defect rates and low fulfillment. Consider negotiating revised SLAs or sourcing alternative vendors if required.

- Implement continuous monitoring systems: Develop a real-time dashboard to track key metrics such as inventory levels, open POs, delivery timelines, and defect rates. Set up automated alerts for early detection of abnormal trends.
  
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vendor  

<img width="1315" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37116bd9-2c69-4d25-97d0-654a25834eea" />

üìå Analysis:   

1. Overall Procurement Performance
- The dashboard indicates that the overall procurement performance is currently strong. The Order Fulfillment Rate and Fulfillment by Quantity have both reached 100% in the most recent month, suggesting that all orders were delivered in full and on time by the vendors.

- The Defect or Return Rate stands at 0.00%, which means there were no returned or defective items this month. While this is a positive sign, it is important to remember that in previous months, defective or returned items still existed and must not be overlooked in long-term evaluations.

- The Average Purchase Price is currently $3.40, showing no month-over-month change and indicating price stability in procurement.

2. Vendor Performance
- Looking at individual vendors, many show relatively high defect or return rates, ranging from approximately 4.4% to 4.9%. The vendors with the highest defect rates include Anderson‚Äôs Custom Bikes, Bicycle Specialists, and SUPERSALES INC. This level of defect rate is considered high, especially for components or raw materials used in production.

- Additionally, the Order Fulfillment Rates for these vendors are also low, mostly ranging between 75% and 77%. This suggests that not only is product quality inconsistent, but these vendors are also not reliably meeting delivery commitments.

- Some vendors also have significantly higher prices compared to others‚Äîsuch as Crowley Sport and Greenwood Athletic Company‚Äîyet they still report relatively high defect rates. This raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of continuing partnerships with those suppliers.

3. Performance Trends Over Time
- Monthly trend data shows that Fulfillment by Quantity has steadily improved over the year, increasing from around 98.9% in January to 100% in September. This is a positive trend indicating enhanced delivery performance.

- However, the Average Lead Time presents a serious concern. While it remained stable at around 9 days for the first eight months of the year, there was a sharp and sudden spike to 25 days in September. This is nearly three times longer than the normal lead time and suggests a major disruption, potentially in logistics, vendor capacity, or supply chain processes.

- Although this delay has not yet affected order fulfillment rates, it poses a serious risk if the trend continues, particularly for just-in-time or time-sensitive production operations.  

üí° Recommendation:  

1. Reevaluate Vendor Performance
Vendors with high defect rates and low fulfillment performance should be thoroughly reviewed‚Äîespecially those with defect rates above 4.5% and fulfillment rates below 77%. These metrics indicate underlying issues in quality control or capacity management. If no improvement is seen after discussions and corrective actions, alternative vendors with better reliability and quality assurance should be considered.

2. Strengthen Quality Control Measures
Despite a 0% defect rate this month, historical data shows consistent quality issues across several vendors. It is recommended to enhance inbound quality inspections, particularly for suppliers with a history of defective deliveries. This will help catch problems before they affect production.

3. Address the Spike in Lead Time
The sudden increase in average lead time to 25 days in September is alarming and should be investigated immediately. The cause could be due to transportation issues, raw material shortages, vendor-side delays, or internal purchasing process changes. Affected vendors should be contacted to identify root causes and take corrective actions. If not resolved, this could disrupt production schedules in the near term.

4. Optimize Purchasing Costs
Some vendors are charging high prices without delivering corresponding value or quality. Procurement teams should reevaluate the cost-to-benefit ratio and renegotiate pricing where applicable. If vendors are unable to meet cost-efficiency benchmarks, switching to more competitive suppliers should be considered.
