## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 
 
This project aims to develop an Operations Dashboard in Power BI to support executive leadership in monitoring and optimizing procurement activities. As supply chain efficiency, accuracy, and cost control become increasingly critical, visualizing procurement data is essential to:

- Ensure goods are ordered at the right time, in the right quantities, and at optimal cost

- Track supplier performance and proactively identify risks such as delays or shortages

- Evaluate the procurement team's ability to meet sales demand across time and product categories

- Empower leadership to make timely, data-driven operational decisions

By delivering this dashboard, the organization will gain a modern, visual management tool that enhances supply chain efficiency and ensures sustainable business growth through informed decision-making.

## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîç Dashboard Preview  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product 

<img width="1315" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9be3f5b-02a3-4e0b-8488-10e79aa04350" />

üìå Analysis:  

Based on the data presented in the dashboard, the procurement activities for raw materials, goods, and semi-finished products during the reviewed period can be assessed as follows:

- Order fulfillment and product quality are at optimal levels: Both the Fulfillment Rate and Defect Rate are at 100% and 0% respectively, indicating a highly efficient procurement and inbound logistics process.

- Significant supply disruption from August onwards: Received quantity and procurement value dropped sharply in August and completely halted by September. This signals potential disruption in the supply chain, possibly due to order delays, halted production schedules, budget constraints, or bottlenecks in internal approval processes.

- Overstocking across multiple items: Numerous products show excessive inventory levels far exceeding their Reorder Points and Safety Stock thresholds, posing risks of inventory obsolescence, increased storage costs, and inefficient capital utilization.

- Poor performance in certain products: Lock Washer 4, 5 and Lock Nut 5, 6 exhibit high defect/return rates (above 9%), while Sport-100 Helmet shows an extremely low fulfillment rate (6.67%). This could directly impact production continuity if these are critical components.

üí° Recommendation:  

Based on the findings above, the following actions are recommended:

- Investigate supply chain disruption from August onwards: Review open purchase orders, procurement schedules, and supplier delivery status. Verify that there are no internal bottlenecks in the approval or payment process.

- Re-evaluate inventory policies: Adjust Safety Stock and Reorder Points, especially for overstocked items. Prioritize consumption of existing stock and implement stock alerts within Power BI to prevent over-ordering.

- Reassess suppliers with poor performance: Perform a vendor performance review focused on suppliers linked to high defect rates and low fulfillment. Consider negotiating revised SLAs or sourcing alternative vendors if required.

- Implement continuous monitoring systems: Develop a real-time dashboard to track key metrics such as inventory levels, open POs, delivery timelines, and defect rates. Set up automated alerts for early detection of abnormal trends.

üìå Analysis:   

- Top revenue-generating products include Phones ($1.38M), Copiers ($1.25M), and Chairs/Bookcases (each $1.20M). In terms of profitability, Copiers lead with $0.22M, followed by Phones ($0.18M) and Bookcases ($0.13M). These products not only deliver high revenue but also maintain solid profit margins, indicating strong potential for long-term sustainability and further expansion.  

- However, several product lines are experiencing unusually high return rates, such as Tables (174.15%), Fasteners (152.01%), and Labels (135.18%). These figures point to serious risks related to product quality or after-sales service processes. In contrast, Phones (44.24%), Chairs (52.36%), and Bookcases (60.54%) show relatively low return rates, suggesting these are more stable and reliable products, less likely to incur extra return or customer service costs.  

- Products positioned in the "high revenue ‚Äì high profit" quadrant ‚Äî such as Copiers, Phones, Bookcases, and Chairs ‚Äî are strategic lines that should continue to be prioritized and strengthened. On the other hand, product lines like Fasteners, Supplies, Furnishings, and Labels, which fall into the "low revenue ‚Äì low profit" zone, should be carefully reviewed for optimization or even removal if necessary.  

- Although smartphones top the revenue chart, they suffer from an extremely high return rate (over 2000%), significantly impacting their actual profitability. Meanwhile, underperforming items such as Avery Binder Labels, Push Pins, and Eureka Bags are experiencing severe losses with return rates as high as 117,200%, indicating no remaining business value and should be considered for elimination.  

üí° Recommendation:  

1. Prioritize Strategic Product Lines
Focus on investing in and expanding high-performing products such as üñ®Ô∏è **Copiers**, üì± **Phones**, üìö **Bookcases**, and ü™ë **Chairs**.. These products significantly contribute to both **revenue** and **profit** while maintaining relatively **low and stable return rates**.

2. Improve Product Quality and After-Sales Processes
For products with ‚ö†Ô∏è **high return rates** such as **Tables**, **Fasteners**, and **Labels**, it's crucial to re-evaluate **product quality**, **packaging**, **product descriptions**, and **return policies** to reduce financial risks caused by excessive returns.

3. Optimize Product Portfolio
Products that fall into the üí∏ **‚Äúlow revenue ‚Äì low profit‚Äù** zone, such as **Fasteners**, **Supplies**, and **Furnishings**, should be gradually phased out or repositioned in the market. This helps the company focus its resources on more profitable lines.

4. Warning on Phone Category
Although the üì± **Phone category** generates the highest revenue, its extremely high return rate is significantly eroding actual profit. Stricter quality control, sourcing from more reputable suppliers, or improving after-sales service are necessary steps to prevent avoidable financial losses.
